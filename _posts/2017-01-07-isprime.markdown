In this post, i thought of brushing up my javascript and analytical skills via a set of mathematical problems. There by i begins with finding a number is prime or not?.To know more about prime look into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

After looking at some solutions i stick with this.

## Key things to be in mind:
* it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself.
* Use Square root to reduce iteration

```javascript
var primeNumber = (function() {
  var divisor = 2;
  return {isPrime: isPrime};
  function isPrime(val){
    if(val === divisor){
      return true;
    }
    if(val === 1){
      return false;
    }
    var sqrt = Math.sqrt(val);
    while(divisor <= sqrt){
      if(val % divisor === 0){
        return false;
      }
      divisor ++;
    }
    return true;
  }

})();
```
